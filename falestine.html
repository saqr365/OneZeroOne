            <h2>Occupied Palestinian Territory</h2>
            <p>The suffering of the Palestinian people continues due to the occupation that prevents them from obtaining their basic human rights and threatens humanitarian security, standing as a stumbling block to any tangible progress in human development. The economic situation has worsened due to the ongoing division between the West Bank and Gaza, economic stagnation, continuous financial crisis, rising unemployment rates, as well as poverty and food insecurity. The recognition by the United Nations General Assembly of Palestine as a non-member observer state (Resolution 67/19, November 29, 2012) provided the Palestinian people with a political boost and raised hopes for significant progress in state-building and achieving social and economic development. However, challenges such as declining donor aid and Israel's withholding of revenues from the budget, along with the expansion of settlements, pose formidable obstacles to implementing specific social, economic, and political development projects. Following economic gains attributed primarily to the revival of the construction sector related to the tunnel economy in Gaza during the period 2008-2011, GDP growth slowed down. The increased political instability and the fading hope of easing Israeli-imposed restrictions on economic activity, coupled with the Israeli military operation in Gaza in 2012, contributed to an increase in the unemployment rate from 21 percent in 2011 to 24.5 percent in 2013. Meanwhile, the Palestinian labor force reached over 1.1 million workers in 2013. However, labor force participation remains low, reaching only 43 percent in June 2013, characterized by a slight increase in female participation but not exceeding 16.6 percent compared to 68.7 percent for males. Youth, especially young women, have been severely affected by the labor market constraints.</p>
